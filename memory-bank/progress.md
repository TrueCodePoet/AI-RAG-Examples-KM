- ✅ Efficient indexing for tabular data
- ✅ Schema management in the same container as data
- ✅ Interface-based design for memory components
- ✅ Robust metadata extraction from text fields
- ✅ Proper tabular data deserialization and storage

### Query Processing

- ❌ Configuration management UI

### Deployment and Operations
- ❌ Containerization for deployment
- ❌ Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- ❌ Performance metrics collection
- ❌ Cost optimization strategies

## Known Issues

### Filter Generation
1. **Field Name Recognition**: The filter generation sometimes struggles with complex or ambiguous field names.
   - **Impact**: Reduced query precision for certain types of questions.
   - **Workaround**: Use more explicit field names in queries.
   - **Planned Fix**: Enhance the filter generation prompt with more examples and context.

2. **Value Extraction**: Extracting specific values from natural language can be imprecise.
   - **Impact**: Filters may not match the intended values exactly.
   - **Workaround**: Use quotes around specific values in queries.
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement post-processing for common value types.

### Excel Processing
1. **Memory Usage**: Processing large Excel files can consume significant memory.
   - **Impact**: Potential out-of-memory errors with very large files.
   - **Workaround**: Split large Excel files into smaller ones.
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement streaming processing for large files.

2. **Format Variations**: Different Excel formatting styles can affect extraction quality.
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent data extraction across different file formats.
   - **Workaround**: Standardize Excel file formatting before processing.
   - **Planned Fix**: Enhance the decoder to handle more format variations.

3. **PivotTable Handling**: Excel files with PivotTables can cause processing errors.
   - **Impact**: Files with PivotTables may be skipped during processing.
   - **Workaround**: Remove PivotTables from Excel files before processing.
   - **Status**: Fixed with enhanced error detection and handling.

### Cosmos DB Integration
1. **Query Complexity**: Complex filters can result in inefficient queries.
   - **Impact**: Slower response times for certain types of questions.
   - **Workaround**: Simplify queries where possible.
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement query optimization strategies.

2. **Cost Management**: Vector operations in Cosmos DB can be costly.
   - **Impact**: Higher than expected Azure costs.
   - **Workaround**: Limit the number of documents processed.
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement tiered storage strategies.

3. **Metadata Extraction**: Source dictionary was sometimes empty due to incorrect extraction.
   - **Impact**: Missing worksheet, row, schema ID, and import batch ID in records.
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed with improved text field parsing and fallback mechanisms.

4. **Data Dictionary Population**: Data dictionary was sometimes empty, losing the actual row data.
   - **Impact**: Loss of structured data fields and values in memory records.
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed with proper deserialization of the tabular_data field.

### Rate Limiting
1. **Azure OpenAI Rate Limits**: Processing large datasets can hit API rate limits.
   - **Impact**: Processing delays due to required wait times between retries.
   - **Workaround**: The system already implements retry with backoff.
   - **Planned Fix**: Add configuration options for rate limiting and batch processing.

### Technical Dependencies
1. **Decoder/Record Format Coupling**: The `TabularExcelDecoder` generates text in a specific "sentence format" which is then parsed by `AzureCosmosDbTabularMemoryRecord`. Changes to this format in either component must be synchronized.
   - **Impact**: Potential for data ingestion errors if formats diverge during development.
   - **Workaround**: Maintain careful testing and coordination when modifying either component.
   - **Planned Fix**: Consider more robust data transfer mechanisms (e.g., dedicated DTO) if this becomes problematic.
