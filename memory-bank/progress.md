# Progress: AI-RAG-Examples-KM

## Current Status
The project is in a functional prototype stage, with core components implemented and basic end-to-end functionality working. The system can process documents from Azure Blob Storage, extract and preserve tabular data, and respond to natural language queries about the structured information.

## What Works

### Document Processing
- ✅ Azure Blob Storage integration for document sources
- ✅ Local file system processing for testing
- ✅ Excel file processing with tabular structure preservation
- ✅ CSV file processing modeled after Excel decoder
- ✅ Data type preservation during extraction
- ✅ Pipeline orchestration with customizable handlers
- ✅ PivotTable structure error handling in Excel files

### Storage and Retrieval
- ✅ Azure Cosmos DB Tabular implementation
- ✅ Vector embedding storage and retrieval
- ✅ Structured data storage with field-level access
- ✅ Basic filtering on data fields
- ✅ Efficient indexing for tabular data
- ✅ Schema management in the same container as data
- ✅ Interface-based design for memory components
- ✅ Robust metadata extraction from text fields
- ✅ Proper tabular data deserialization and storage

### Query Processing
- ✅ Natural language query handling
- ✅ AI-driven filter generation
- ✅ Structured query execution against Cosmos DB
- ✅ Response formatting with source attribution
- ✅ Basic error handling for query failures
- ✅ Schema-based parameter validation
- ✅ Result limiting for large result sets
- ✅ Fully configurable fuzzy matching (LIKE/CONTAINS) via appsettings.json
- ✅ Dynamic AI prompt adapts to fuzzy match operator
- ✅ Robust AND/OR logic in filters (multiple keys = AND, arrays = OR)
- ✅ Backend supports both AND and OR logic, translating to SQL WHERE clauses
- ✅ Filter value type preservation for LIKE/CONTAINS/OR logic: Arrays are now preserved as List<string> and handled robustly in query logic
- ✅ Consistent Base64 encoding of record IDs

### Configuration and Setup
- ✅ Configuration loading from appsettings.json
- ✅ Azure service integration (OpenAI, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage)
- ✅ Dependency injection for components
- ✅ Pipeline configuration and customization

## What Didn't Work / Lessons Learned

### Reflection-based IMemoryDb Access (Deprecated)
- ❌ Reflection-based access to memory components (e.g., using `MemoryHelper.GetMemoryDbFromKernelMemory`) was unreliable and fragile.
  - **Why it failed:** This approach depended on private/internal field names and implementation details of `IKernelMemory` (e.g., `_memoryDb`), which are not guaranteed to be present or stable across versions or implementations (e.g., `MemoryServerless`).
  - **Impact:** Broke with certain implementations, caused errors like "Could not find _memoryDb field in memory object", and made the system brittle to framework changes.
  - **Lesson:** Avoid reflection-based hacks for core service resolution. Prefer explicit Dependency Injection (DI) for all critical dependencies.
  - **Status:** Fully replaced by DI-based approach. Do NOT retry reflection-based access for memory components.

### Prompt/Query Logic Must Match Backend Capabilities
- ❌ Hardcoding fuzzy match logic or prompt instructions leads to mismatches and confusion.
  - **Lesson:** Always read operator/config from appsettings.json and dynamically adapt the AI prompt and backend logic.
  - **Status:** Now fully dynamic and robust; prompt and backend always match config.

## What's Left to Build

### Document Processing Enhancements
- ✅ CSV support implemented
- ❌ Support for additional tabular formats (JSON, etc.)
- ❌ Advanced Excel feature support (formulas, charts, etc.)
- ❌ Batch processing for multiple documents
- ❌ Incremental updates to existing documents

### Query Capabilities
- ❌ Advanced filtering (ranges, fuzzy matching, etc.)
- ❌ Query optimization for large datasets
- ❌ Cross-document queries
- ❌ Query history and caching

### Search Enhancement Plans (Added 2025-04-09)
- ❌ Fuzzy Matching for Field Values - Allow partial matches using CONTAINS/STARTSWITH operators
- ❌ Field Normalization - Case-insensitive matching and text normalization
- ❌ Synonym Handling - Enhance LLM prompt to generate alternative values and use IN clauses
- ❌ Filter Expansion - Auto-expand filters based on column metadata from schema
- ❌ Schema Information Enhancement - Include more examples and variations in prompt

### User Interface

### Deployment and Operations
- ❌ Containerization for deployment
- ❌ Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- ❌ Performance metrics collection
- ❌ Cost optimization strategies

## Known Issues

### Filter Generation
1. **Field Name Recognition**: The filter generation sometimes struggles with complex or ambiguous field names.
   - **Impact**: Reduced query precision for certain types of questions.
   - **Workaround**: Use more explicit field names in queries.
   - **Planned Fix**: Enhance the filter generation prompt with more examples and context.

2. **Value Extraction**: Extracting specific values from natural language can be imprecise.
   - **Impact**: Filters may not match the intended values exactly.
   - **Workaround**: Use quotes around specific values in queries.
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement post-processing for common value types.

### Excel Processing
1. **Memory Usage**: Processing large Excel files can consume significant memory.
   - **Impact**: Potential out-of-memory errors with very large files.
   - **Workaround**: Split large Excel files into smaller ones.
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement streaming processing for large files.

2. **Format Variations**: Different Excel formatting styles can affect extraction quality.
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent data extraction across different file formats.
   - **Workaround**: Standardize Excel file formatting before processing.
   - **Planned Fix**: Enhance the decoder to handle more format variations.

3. **PivotTable Handling**: Excel files with PivotTables can cause processing errors.
   - **Impact**: Files with PivotTables may be skipped during processing.
   - **Workaround**: Remove PivotTables from Excel files before processing.
   - **Status**: Fixed with enhanced error detection and handling.

### Cosmos DB Integration
1. **Query Complexity**: Complex filters can result in inefficient queries.
   - **Impact**: Slower response times for certain types of questions.
   - **Workaround**: Simplify queries where possible.
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement query optimization strategies.

2. **Vector Field Mismatch**: Inconsistency between field names in code and serialized JSON.
   - **Impact**: Vector queries failing with field not found errors.
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed by updating all SQL queries to use the correct field name.

3. **VectorDistance Sorting Issues**: Cosmos DB doesn't support ASC/DESC with VectorDistance.
   - **Impact**: Vector search queries would fail with BadRequest errors.
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed by removing ASC directive from ORDER BY clauses.

4. **Limited Results Only**: No support for unlimited query results.
   - **Impact**: Could only fetch a fixed number of results per query.
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed by adding support for limit=0 to return all matching records.

5. **Cost Management**: Vector operations in Cosmos DB can be costly.
   - **Impact**: Higher than expected Azure costs.
   - **Workaround**: Limit the number of documents processed.
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement tiered storage strategies.

6. **Metadata Extraction**: Source dictionary was sometimes empty due to incorrect extraction.
   - **Impact**: Missing worksheet, row, schema ID, and import batch ID in records.
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed with improved text field parsing and fallback mechanisms.

7. **Data Dictionary Population**: Data dictionary was sometimes empty, losing the actual row data.
   - **Impact**: Loss of structured data fields and values in memory records.
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed with proper deserialization of the tabular_data field.

### TabularFilterHelper Issues
1. **Dynamic Type Errors in Asynchronous Contexts**: Using dynamic types with asynchronous iteration.
   - **Impact**: Build errors with "Cannot use a collection of dynamic type in an asynchronous foreach".
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed by redesigning TabularFilterHelper to use .NET Reflection API instead of dynamic typing.

2. **Robust Method Invocation**: Previous approach was fragile with method calls on dynamic objects.
   - **Impact**: Potential runtime errors if method signatures or return types changed.
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed by implementing explicit method lookup and invocation via reflection with strong error handling.

3. **IMemoryDb Access Failure via Reflection**: The helper fails when initialized with `IKernelMemory` because the reflection logic (`MemoryHelper`) cannot find the expected `_memoryDb` field in the `MemoryServerless` implementation.
   - **Impact**: Prevents dataset identification and schema-based operations.
   - **Workaround**: Implemented fallback mechanism to work with empty/default results when reflection fails.
   - **Status**: Partially fixed (added fault tolerance). Complete solution planned via DI refactoring.

8. **(Resolved)** `System.FormatException`: 'Input is not a valid Base-64 string' during record retrieval.
   - **Cause:** Record `Id` was not encoded using `EncodeId` before storage.
   - **Solution:** Ensured `EncodeId` is used consistently when creating `AzureCosmosDbTabularMemoryRecord` instances (verified in `FromMemoryRecord`).
   - **Status**: Fixed.

9. **(Monitoring)** Potential CSV Row Skipping: Initial tests showed fewer rows imported from CSV than expected.
   - **Cause:** Potentially incorrect `HeaderRowIndex` config or blank lines in the CSV.
   - **Mitigation:** Added detailed logging (`totalLines`, `totalRowsAdded`) to `TabularCsvDecoder` to help diagnose during further testing.
   - **Status**: Monitoring.

### Result Presentation
1. **Overwhelming Results for Large Datasets**: No control over the number of results shown to users.
   - **Impact**: Users could be overwhelmed by large result sets, especially for queries matching many records.
   - **Workaround**: None needed, issue has been fixed.
   - **Status**: Fixed by adding a resultLimit parameter to AskTabularQuestionAsync and implementing post-query limiting.

### Rate Limiting
1. **Azure OpenAI Rate Limits**: Processing large datasets can hit API rate limits.
   - **Impact**: Processing delays due to required wait times between retries.
   - **Workaround**: The system already implements retry with backoff.
   - **Planned Fix**: Add configuration options for rate limiting and batch processing.

### Technical Dependencies
1. **Decoder/Record Format Coupling**: The `TabularExcelDecoder` generates text in a specific "sentence format" which is then parsed by `AzureCosmosDbTabularMemoryRecord`. Changes to this format in either component must be synchronized.
   - **Impact**: Potential for data ingestion errors if formats diverge during development.
   - **Workaround**: Maintain careful testing and coordination when modifying either component.
   - **Planned Fix**: Consider more robust data transfer mechanisms (e.g., dedicated DTO) if this becomes problematic.
